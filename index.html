    <h4>So far...</h4>
          <p><small>Many efforts are being made to help the victims of the flood in Chennai. Organizations, individuals in the city, the army, the state government, citizens from around the country and people from around the world have all been contributing to the relief and rescue efforts in the city. Social media has played a vital role in making these contributions possible and relevant.</small></p><br>

          <h4>What's wrong with this picture?</h4>
          <p><small>What is lacking amongst the civilian volunteers and organizations is coordination. The lack of coordination and organization has led to waste of time and resources. Out-dated posts, retweets, statuses and focus on camps as opposed to stranded areas has led to a mismatched supply demand ratio. Have you landed up at a place with supplies and found out they were not needed? Have you heard complaints that a few people were hogging all the resources? Did you see places that have more than enough food, but no medicines/sheets/clothes/sanitary pads etc. All of us can do a better job if we can understand which supplies are needed, when, and where.</small></p><br>

          <h4>What we are doing:</h4>
          <p><small>We will try to assist both the people in need of help and the people who want to help. We will provide tools for voluteers to get up to date information, so they can be as effective as possible. A huge amount of aid is required over the coming weeks, and we will only be pull it off if we work together. Use these tools to coordinate your own group's activities. This website will go live by Monday morning (7/12/2015). </small></p><br>

          <h4>What you can do:</h4>
          <br>

          <ol>
          <li>If you can get out and help, find a volunteer group near you.</li><br>
          <li>If you have dry space, register as a Supply Depot and report accurately what stocks are available.</li><br>
          <li>If you have transport, we will connect you to the closest Supply Depot and affected areas.</li><br>
          <li>If you have space to accomodate the stranded, we will direct people to you.</li><br>
          <li>If you have stable internet and phone networks, we can use your help to source, verify, and clean up the information that is flooding in.</li><br>
          <li>Tell us what you need to do the best possible work. </li><br>
          </ol>
          <p><small>
          Let's be smart and make every contribution count.</small> </p>
